# Postman Testing API for [Trello](https://trello.com/)

## About the Tool

This project is a test automation suite developed using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for the [Trello](https://trello.com/) website. The tool is designed to automate the testing of various functionalities on the Trello platform, ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience.

Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.

1. Create a board
2. Get a board
3. Update the board's description
4. Delete the board
   
Also, added assertions for headers, status code and body of response. Added script into package.json to run API tests through the CLI (using Newman tool).
